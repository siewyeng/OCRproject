# Meme Summarization

## Introduction

Inspired by my parents who sometimes look at a meme and say "I don't get it", this project aims to create an interface to explain a meme.

A pretrained CLIP model is used to generate the summary of image.

## Usage
* Ensure that the environment has pytorch before starting. If it does not have pytorch yet, please install from the [Pytorch site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with your preferred configurations for the compute platform.
